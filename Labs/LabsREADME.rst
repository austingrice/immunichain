============

**Comprehensive Overview of Hyperledger Composer with a Taste of Hyperledger Fabric**

Labs:
=====

**Immunichain: The Big Kahuna**

If you go through this entire lab, you are going to be operating on multiple environments. One environment is going to be a Linux (SLES) instance operating on a LinuxONE. This environment is supported through the LinuxONE Community Cloud. Another is a Kubernetes environment, in which you will be using Hyperledger Composer. As you move throughout the lab, you will create a network from scratch and then test your network out through transactions. Then you add some participants and privacy through access control lists. Once you deploy your network onto the Hyperledger Fabric, you will open your business network to a REST Server. 

**Immunichain: Cloud**

In this lab, you are going to use a Kubernetes environment to use Hyperledger Composer. You are going to create your network from scratch. Then you will create assets and participants. To end, you will submit transactions amongst the various participants and assets.

**Immunichain: Cloud with Privacy**

In this lab, you are going to follow most of the Immunichain Cloud lab. You are going to add some privacy with access control lists. You will create various identities and observe and submit transactions from each perspective.

**Immunichain: Fabric**

In this lab, you will create your blockchain business network from scratch that is deployed to the Hyperledger Fabric. You will then create various participants and assets within this business network. To end, you will submit transactions amongst these participants and assets.

**Immunichain: Fabric with Privacy**

In this lab, you will follow most of the Immunichain: Fabric lab, but we will add an additional part. That part will consist of creating privacy with access control lists. You will create various identities and observe and submit transactions from each perspective.

**Immunichain: Fabric with REST APIs**

In this lab, you wil follow most of the Immunichain: Fabric with Privacy lab, but you will expose your network to a REST Server. Using the identities you create, you will open up a REST server from each perspective.
